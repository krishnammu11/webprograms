 <title>HTML Frames</title>

 <h1>HTML Frames</h1>
 <p>HTML frames allow you to divide a web page into multiple sections or 
frames, each with its own HTML document. Frames were commonly used in 
the past to create complex layouts, but they are now considered outdated and 
not recommended for modern web development. Instead, CSS and responsive 
design techniques are preferred for creating flexible and mobile-friendly 
layouts.</p>
 <p>It's important to note that frames are not supported in HTML5, and 
modern web development practices focus on using CSS for layout and 
JavaScript for dynamic interactions. If you need to create a multi-column layout 
or include external content in your webpage, consider using CSS flexbox, grid, 
or other layout techniques instead of frames.</p>

 <h1>HTML Lists</h1>
 <p>HTML provides a way to organize and present information using lists. 
Lists allow you to display information in a structured and easy-to-read format. 
There are three main types of lists in HTML:</p>
 <h2>1. Unordered Lists (UL)</h2>
 <p>An unordered list is used to represent a list of items that have no specific 
order. Each item in the list is preceded by a bullet point (or other list 
marker).</p>
 
 <h2>2. Ordered Lists (OL)</h2>
 <p>An ordered list is used to represent a list of items that have a specific 
order or sequence. Each item in the list is numbered. </p>

 <h1>HTML Tables</h1>
 <p>HTML tables are a fundamental part of web page layout and are used to 
organize and display data in a structured format. Tables consist of rows and 
columns, where each cell in the table can contain text, images, links, or other 
HTML elements.</p>
<p>When rendered in a web browser, this code creates a table with two rows 
and two columns, where the first row contains header cells (in bold) and the 
subsequent rows contain data cells.</p>
